The lab3 directory contains:
Test
A subdirectory containing input .obj files to disassemble

makefile
An empty makefile as a reminder that you should create one
to build your program. You may use your Tools.cpp from lab1
if you need to use some bitmanipulation functions.

efbdis
My version of the disassembler. You can use this to generate
output for each .obj file and compare it to what your
disassembler generates. You can use the diff utility to help.

For example, if you do the following:

y86dis file.obj > myoutput
efbdis file.obj > efboutput
diff myoutput efboutput

the diff command should produce no output (files are identical)
